# Snowflake ELT Pipeline for NYC Taxi Data Analysis üöï

This project demonstrates a complete and robust ELT (Extract, Load, Transform) pipeline built on **Snowflake**, ingesting data from **AWS S3**. It transforms raw NYC taxi trip data into a clean, analytics-ready **star schema** to enable efficient business intelligence and data analysis.

---
## üèõÔ∏è Project Architecture

The pipeline follows a modern, multi-layered data architecture, ensuring a clear separation between raw and transformed data. This approach enhances scalability, data integrity, and re-processability.



1.  **External Data Stage (S3):** Raw CSV data is stored and managed in an AWS S3 bucket. A secure connection is established using a Snowflake **Storage Integration**, which allows Snowflake to read from the bucket without exposing credentials.
2.  **Staging Layer (Load):** A manual `COPY` command ingests the data from S3 into a raw staging table (`STG_TRIPS`) within a dedicated `RAW` schema. This table is a direct, unfiltered copy of the source data.
3.  **Analytics Layer (Transform):** A SQL script runs within Snowflake to clean, model, and transform the raw data into a dimensional model (star schema) in a separate `ANALYTICS` schema. This creates the final, business-ready tables.

## ‚≠ê Data Model: The Star Schema

The core of this project is a **dimensional model** (star schema), which is the industry standard for building fast and intuitive data warehouses for analytics. It consists of a central fact table containing quantitative measurements, surrounded by descriptive dimension tables that provide context.

### Schema Visualization

The diagram below illustrates the relationships between the fact and dimension tables, including their primary keys (PK) and foreign keys (FK).
